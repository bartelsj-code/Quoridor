At start:
All physically possible placements are added to a set.
illegal_placements will be stored in such a way that pawn moves or a dictionary

During play:
When a wall is placed: 
    1. Intersecting wall placements are removed from the set.
    
    2. Placements that become illegal (but remain physically possible) are removed from the set and set aside:
        2.1 Placements are narrowed down to just the likely illegal ones:
            Placements that are illegal will... (illegality --> attribute):
                - either connect two existing walls, or an existing wall with an edge.
                - either be adjacent to the wall that was most recently placed or a wall that is directly or indirectly connected to it (not including edges).
                - close off an area(s) from the rest of the board?
                - 

        2.2 Then, candidates are checked for illegality.
            Attributes that make a placement illegal (attribute --> illegality)
                - For one or more of the players:
                    - There exists no path from their pawn to any of their goal squares that does not cross a wall
                    - 
    
When a pawn moves:
    1. Check if any marked-illegal moves become legal (should be constant time if done right) and add them back into play if they are
    2. For all open wall placements that this move crosses:
        If illegal:
            add to them to illegal stash
        if legal:
            ignore
