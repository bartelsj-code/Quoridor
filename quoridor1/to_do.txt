These are elements that should be implemented at some point


Union find update rather than reset

Check if played placement has an adjacency in the first place (or either half has two)

In tree, when all walls are placed, use shortest distance to target (account for jumps using bishop idea maybe)




We first figure out which placements are suspect, then check them for illegality

test move along each edge


Pursue Path Following Approach:
    For each player:
        Go to their pawn and find the shortest path to a goal square. Remember path. Mark each (may or may not have to be limited to one direction at a time) border crossed that is not already marked illegal.
        Go again, this time not crossing anything marked the first time around. Mark again (may fail)
        Now do a bfs from the goal to the node. any Marked wall you can reach both sides of is legal. If you reach the goal, there are no illegals.
        If not:
             any adjacent (to the zone) marked segments must be part of an illegal placement. 
             (two adjacent ones indicate illegality of only that placement, one indicates that both placements that include it are illegal)
             Continue BFS out after unmarking the illegal ones. (repeat until you reach player coords)
