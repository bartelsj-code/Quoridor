Possible approach to path caching:

Paths need to be initialized at start.

if a player moves their pawn along the path, the path just becomes shorter. If a player moves their pawn in a different way only their path needs to be reevaluated.

If a wall is placed any path intersected by that wall needs to be reevaluated.

shortest move should just be first part of path
