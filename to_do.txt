These are elements that should be implemented at some point


Union find update rather than reset

Check if played placement has an adjacency in the first place (or either half has two)

In tree, when all walls are placed, use shortest distance to target (account for jumps using bishop idea maybe)




We first figure out which placements are suspect, then check them for illegality

test move along each edge
